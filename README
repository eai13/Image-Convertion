Training code
The library provides:
	-Reading .bmp images, .yuv images and .yuv video files
	-Addition of .yuv image to .yuv video file
	-Conversion from .BMP to .YUV
	-Conversion RGB -> GRAY
	-Conversion RGB <-> HSV
	-Saving .YUV, .BMP images and .YUV videos

This is just a code for training for now.
But it may further be turned into library for working with images and video files.
Just need some free time for that :)
