Training code
The library provides functions:
	-for reading .bmp images, .yuv images and .yuv video files
	-for conversion from .bmp to .yuv
	-for adding .yuv image to .yuv video file
	-for conversion from RGB to GRAY
	-for saving .bmp file

This is just a code for training for now.
But it may further be turned into library for working with images and video files.
Just need some free time for that :)
